# Getting Started with Next.js 14 and TypeScript

Next.js 14 has revolutionized the way we build React applications, introducing powerful features like the App Router, Server Components, and improved performance optimizations. In this post, we'll explore how to leverage these features to build modern, scalable web applications.

## What's New in Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings several exciting features:

- **Turbopack**: A new bundler that's significantly faster than Webpack
- **Server Actions**: Simplified server-side form handling
- **Partial Prerendering**: Improved performance for dynamic content
- **Enhanced Image Optimization**: Better loading and performance

## Setting Up Your Project

Getting started with Next.js 14 is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## App Router vs Pages Router

The App Router introduces a new paradigm for routing in Next.js applications. Unlike the traditional Pages Router, the App Router uses a file-system based routing where:

- `app/page.tsx` represents the home page
- `app/about/page.tsx` represents the `/about` route
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` represents dynamic routes like `/blog/my-post`

## Server Components by Default

One of the most significant changes is that components are Server Components by default. This means:

- Components render on the server
- No JavaScript is sent to the client for these components
- Better performance and SEO
- Direct database access without API routes

```tsx
// This is a Server Component by default
export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## TypeScript Integration

Next.js 14 has excellent TypeScript support out of the box. Key benefits include:

- Automatic type checking
- IntelliSense support
- Type-safe routing with `next/navigation`
- Built-in types for Next.js APIs

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in React development. The combination of Server Components, improved performance, and developer experience makes it an excellent choice for modern web applications.

Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex e-commerce platform, Next.js 14 provides the tools and performance optimizations you need to succeed.
